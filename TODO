keep model and transcoder over runs
move model back from gpu to create a save package



reduce features for token, layer where they are in thousands


feature visualization - hopefully dint have to do

    epsilon = 1e-9  # Define your threshold for "very close to zero"
    indices = activation_matrix.indices()
    values = activation_matrix.values()
    
    mask = torch.abs(values) > epsilon
    
    activation_matrix = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(
        indices[:, mask], values[mask], activation_matrix.shape
    )
